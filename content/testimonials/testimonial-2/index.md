Shane is an absolute rockstar. From the very beginning he took 100% ownership of a mobile application that had been previously outsourced and got to work re-building it from the ground up. He has an uncanny ability to not only do great development work but also put a voice and reason to the work he does, communicating effectively with a team of marketing professionals that doesn’t speak developer. He has always been so intentional and meticulous in the decisions he makes and is an autonomous and efficient as they come. To put it bluntly - you’d be lucky to get to work with Shane. He’s truly a fantastic human and as good as they come.
